/-- **Strong continuity of U(t) on the dense set.**

For any formal sum `α = Σⱼ cⱼ δ_{sⱼ}`, we have
  ‖U(t)(embed α) - embed α‖² = Re⟨U(t)α - α, U(t)α - α⟩_f

Expanding the bilinear form over the finite support:
  = Σⱼ Σₖ c̄ⱼ cₖ [2f(sₖ-sⱼ) - f(sₖ-sⱼ+t) - f(sₖ-sⱼ-t)]

Each term → 0 as t → 0 by continuity of f (proved in IsContinuous.continuity).
Since the sum is finite, the whole expression → 0.

This gives: for each α, ‖U(t)(embed α) - embed α‖ → 0 as t → 0.
By the group law, t ↦ U(t)(embed α) is continuous at every point. -/

/-- **Strong continuity extends to all of H.**

Given:
- Strong continuity on a dense set D ⊆ H
- Each U(t) is an isometry
Then U(t) is strongly continuous on all of H.

Standard 3ε argument: for ψ ∈ H and ε > 0,
1. Pick φ ∈ D with ‖ψ - φ‖ < ε/3
2. Pick δ so |t| < δ ⟹ ‖U(t)φ - φ‖ < ε/3
3. Then ‖U(t)ψ - ψ‖ ≤ ‖U(t)(ψ-φ)‖ + ‖U(t)φ - φ‖ + ‖φ - ψ‖
                       = ‖ψ-φ‖ + ‖U(t)φ - φ‖ + ‖φ - ψ‖ < ε -/
