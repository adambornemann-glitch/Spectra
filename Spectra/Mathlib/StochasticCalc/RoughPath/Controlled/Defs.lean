# Gubinelli Controlled Rough Paths

## Overview

A path `Y : [a,b] → E` is **controlled by a rough path** `X` if its increments
are "explained" by the rough path up to a well-behaved remainder:

    Y(t) - Y(s) = Y'(s) · X_{s,t} + R^Y_{s,t}

where:
- `Y' : [a,b] → L(V, E)` is the **Gubinelli derivative** — a `γ`-Hölder function
  describing how `Y` responds to the driving signal `X`
- `R^Y_{s,t}` is the **controlled remainder** — a `2γ`-Hölder two-parameter function
- `X_{s,t}` is the level-1 increment of the rough path

The key insight: `R^Y` is `2γ`-Hölder, and integrating it against the `γ`-Hölder
path `X` requires `2γ + γ = 3γ > 1` — which holds precisely when `γ > 1/3`.
This is the analytical engine that makes rough integration work.

## Why this formulation?

In Lyons' original framework, rough integration is defined directly via the
Universal Limit Theorem. In Gubinelli's framework (2004), one first identifies
the *class of integrands* — controlled paths — and then the integral is a
straightforward application of the sewing lemma with approximation

    Ξ(s,t) = Y(s) · X_{s,t} + Y'(s) · 𝕏_{s,t}

The defect of this approximation involves `R^Y` integrated against `X` (a Young
integral, handled by Stage 1) plus `(Y'(u) - Y'(s)) · 𝕏_{u,t}` (bounded at
order `3γ`). The total defect is `O(|t-s|^{3γ})` with `3γ > 1`, so the sewing
machine converges.

This formulation is dramatically cleaner for formalization because:
1. The sewing lemma is already built (Stage 0)
2. The Young integral is already built (Stage 1)
3. The algebraic structure is already built (this stage)
4. The controlled path structure isolates the analytical content

## Design decisions

**The Gubinelli derivative `Y'` maps `V → E`.** More precisely, `Y'(s)` is a
continuous linear map `V →L[ℝ] E`. This is because `Y'(s) · X_{s,t}` must
produce an element of `E` from the `V`-valued increment `X_{s,t}`.

**Boundedness of `Y` is recorded separately.** The controlled path structure
gives Hölder regularity of `Y`, but the *supremum* bound `‖Y‖_∞ ≤ M` is needed
as a separate hypothesis in the rough integral estimates. We store it as a
field rather than deriving it (which would require compactness of [a,b]).

**Explicit constants everywhere.** The Picard iteration for rough ODEs needs to
track how the constants of the output controlled path depend on the input.
Every bound carries its explicit constant.

## Mathematical content

### The controlled path decomposition

    Y(t) = Y(s) + Y'(s) · X_{s,t} + R^Y_{s,t}

This is a first-order Taylor expansion of `Y` along the rough path `X`:
- `Y'(s)` plays the role of the derivative
- `X_{s,t}` plays the role of `Δt`
- `R^Y_{s,t}` is the remainder, controlled at order `(Δt)^{2γ}` rather than `(Δt)^2`

### Regularity of the Gubinelli derivative

    ‖Y'(t) - Y'(s)‖ ≤ C_{Y'} · |t - s|^γ

The derivative itself is `γ`-Hölder. This means `Y'` is as rough as the driving
path — it is part of the "controlled" world, not the "smooth" world.

### Regularity of the remainder

    ‖R^Y_{s,t}‖ ≤ C_R · |t - s|^{2γ}

This is `2γ`-Hölder — twice the regularity of the path. This improved regularity
is the entire point: it's what allows the Young integral of `R^Y` against `X`
to converge (since `2γ + γ = 3γ > 1`).

### Regularity of Y itself

From the decomposition:
    ‖Y(t) - Y(s)‖ ≤ ‖Y'(s)‖ · ‖X_{s,t}‖ + ‖R^Y_{s,t}‖
                   ≤ M_{Y'} · C_X · |t-s|^γ + C_R · |t-s|^{2γ}
                   ≤ (M_{Y'} · C_X + C_R · diam^γ) · |t-s|^γ

So `Y` is `γ`-Hölder — it inherits the regularity of the driving signal.

/-! ## The remainder's "defect" identity

When we compute the defect of the rough integral approximation, the
remainder's behaviour under Chen's identity plays a central role.

The key identity:
  R(s,t) = R(s,u) + R(u,t) + [Y'(u) - Y'(s)] · X_{u,t}

This comes from the decomposition at three points and Chen's identity. -/

/-- **Remainder defect identity**: `R(s,t) - R(s,u) - R(u,t) = (Y'(u) - Y'(s)) · X_{u,t}`.

This is the "almost additivity" of the remainder: it fails to be additive by
a term involving the variation of `Y'` times the path increment. -/

/-! ## The rough integral approximation map

This is what `Integral/Defect.lean` will use: the approximation

    Ξ(s,t) = Y(s) · X_{s,t} + Y'(s) · 𝕏_{s,t}

and the defect of this approximation is O(|t-s|^{3γ}). -/

/-- The **rough integral approximation**: `Ξ(s,t) = Y(s) · X_{s,t} + Y'(s) · 𝕏_{s,t}`.

This is the left-point Riemann sum with a second-order correction from the area.
The Young approximation `Y(s) · X_{s,t}` alone has defect `O(|t-s|^{2γ})`, which
doesn't converge for `γ ≤ 1/2`. The area correction `Y'(s) · 𝕏_{s,t}` improves
the defect to `O(|t-s|^{3γ})`, which converges for `γ > 1/3`. -/

/-! ## The driving signal as a controlled path

The rough path `X` itself is controlled by itself, with Gubinelli
derivative `Y' = id` and remainder `R = 0`. More precisely, the
underlying path `t ↦ X_{a,t}` is controlled with `Y'(s) = id_V`
(the identity map). But this requires `E = V`.

In the general theory, for `f : V → L(V, E)`, the controlled path
`Y = f(X)` has Gubinelli derivative `Y' = Df(X)·f(X)`. We defer
this to `Controlled/Algebra.lean`. -/

/-- The **identity controlled path**: `X` controls itself.

When `E = V`, the path `t ↦ X_{a,t}` is controlled by `X` with
`Y'(s) = id_V` and `R(s,t) = 0`.

This is the base case for the Picard iteration. -/
